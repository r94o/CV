I've been working in the Energy Industry for the last 6 years however technology has been a part of my life for much longer. I have a passion for productivity and efficiency which has led me to the world of software development where the possibilities are endless.

In my own time, I learnt how to automate parts of my job and my interest spiralled from there. I came to the realisation that I enjoy coding far more than my job itself and decided to apply to a selective bootcamp, Makers Academy.

I have now graduated and have learnt more than I could have ever imagined. I can't wait to put my knowledge into practice and make a difference within a company from day 1.

I believe the best way to learn is independent research, asking questions and simply getting involved. I care about **how and why** things work, rather than simply that it works. I have a drive to succeed and to produce the best work I can.

What excites me about this industry is that it is constantly evolving. There are endless routes that you can take and there is no limit to how much you can learn. I value the openness to sharing knowledge and this is something I definitely want to be a part of.
