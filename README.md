I've been working in the Energy Industry for the last 6 years however technology has been a part of my life for much longer. I have a passion for productivity and efficiency which has led me to the world of software development where the possibilities are endless.

In my own time, I learnt how to automate parts of my job and my interest spiralled from there. I came to the realisation that I enjoy coding far more than my job itself and decided to apply to a selective bootcamp, Makers Academy.

I have now graduated and have learnt more than I could have ever imagined. I can't wait to put my knowledge into practice and make a difference within a company from day 1.

I believe the best way to learn is independent research, asking questions and simply getting involved. I care about **how and why** things work, rather than simply that it works. I have a drive to succeed and to produce the best work I can.

What excites me about this industry is that it is constantly evolving. There are endless routes that you can take and there is no limit to how much you can learn. I value the openness to sharing knowledge and this is something I definitely want to be a part of.

## Work Experience

**Control Energy Costs** (April-2016 to February-2022)  
_Market Analyst_

- Generated an income of £2 million for the company over 4.5 years.
- Day to day managing and developing my own portfolio of over 100 clients – including several key multi-site clients with an annual utility spend between £3.5 – £7.5 million (Electricity, Gas & Water).
- Evaluate, analyse and present recommendations to key stakeholders on the most cost effective contract structure/procurement strategy for each utility.
- Audit customer’s utility invoices to identify complex overcharges and recover refunds.
- Identify potential risks within changes to energy market fundamentals and understand how this will impact
customers.
- Assist client base with analysis of energy consumption data to identify unusual consumption patterns.

_Outside of job role_
- Proactively developed several Python scripts in my own time that use the Selenium/Requests library to automatically download customer invoices from multiple energy supplier’s portals, sorting each invoice based on priority ready for processing. This has saved the administration team at least 1.5 hours per day.
- Developed several tools to aid productivity in my own role mainly based around extracting data from websites/API’s automatically and extracting text from PDF documents.


**Allianz Global Assistance** (September 2013 to April 2016)  
_Senior Assistance Resolution Co-Ordinator October 2015 – April 2016_

_Relevant Experience_
- Creating VBA Macros to assist with reporting assistance case summaries to management.
- Mentoring junior members of the team


## Skills

#### Research/Independent Learning
During group projects at Makers Academy there were multiple occasions where new technology had to be learnt with little to no guidance.
Over the course of 3 group projects I took the lead in investigating setting up an ORM (ActiveRecord), CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions) and the deployment of our web app to Heroku.

Initially, I looked at the documentation provided by each of these technologies which can be intimidating to a junior developer. I took the time to research any concepts/terms within this documentation that I didn't understand. 

With this knowledge I then researched examples from Stack Overflow, articles and YouTube to make sure I fully understood the concepts and then implemented into our project.

I made sure to share this knowledge to my team and acted as a resource for any questions going forward.

#### Attention to detail
A responsibility of my previous role was to identify refund opportunities for my clients where their energy supplier has overcharged them. Some of the supplier errors can be incredibly intricate.

I was reviewing a prospective client's water invoices and noticed one particular charge seemed rather high. This charge is based on the area of land the client occupies (assigned to a band). I was able to calculate the true area of the property through Google Map's satellite view and using this evidence I made a claim to the water supplier. They accepted the error and refunded the customer several thousand pounds and also reduced the charge going forward.

This was a key factor in the company becoming a client of ours.

#### Working to deadlines
Another responsibility of my previous role was to tender my clients electricity, gas and water supplies to all relevant energy suppliers. This process is very time consuming, involving negotiating with suppliers and collating all pricing information to present to clients on the same day.

Due to the live nature of the energy market, contract offers are only valid for the day they are generated. It was crucial that I was organised in my approach to deliver on the expectations set by the client and to provide the most value during our meetings.


## Education

#### Makers Academy (February-2022 to May-2022)

- Selective software engineering bootcamp covering Ruby and full-stack Javascript.

- Built programs/applications following object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, using a test driven development (TDD) approach, effective debugging processes and a model, view, controller (MVC) structure.

- Worked on group, pair and individual projects, collaborating using Github.

- Used agile methodologies and values throughout (e.g. minimum viable product, user stories, sprint planning, pair programming, daily stand ups, retrospectives).

- Covered emotional intelligence curriculum (e.g. giving feedback, receiving feedback, teamwork, pairing, empathy.

#### Wallington County Grammar School (Finished 2012)

- A Levels - Design & Technology, Mathematics & Physics
- AS Level - Biology

## Hobbies

I have started my collection of Hue lightbulbs and am currently learning about home automation with Home Assistant.

I enjoy cooking, pub quizzes and sports (mainly tennis & golf).
