I've been working in the Energy Industry for the last six years however technology has been a part of my life for much longer. I have a passion for productivity and efficiency and this had led me to the world of software development where the possibilities are endless.

Starting with the goal of automating parts of my job, I have developed several Python scripts to benefit myself and colleagues - ultimately saving around 1.5 hours per day. 

The satisfaction of using technology to solve real world problems and increase efficiency was too great to ignore. I knew this was the career path for me so I made the decision to apply to a selective software engineering bootcamp, Makers Academy. I have learned so much through this experience and it has only increased my desire to be in the industry. 

I like to learn through independent research, asking questions and simply getting involved. I care about **how and why** things work, rather than simply that it works.

The software industry is constantly evolving and there is so much to learn and contribute to. I value the openness in sharing knowledge and it excites me that in the not too distant future I will be able to make an impact both to the company I work for and the wider software engineering community.

## Work Experience

**Control Energy Costs** (April-2016 to February-2022)  
_Market Analyst_

- Generated an income of £2 million for the company over 4.5 years.
- Day to day managing and developing my own portfolio of over 100 clients – including several key multi-site clients with an annual utility spend between £3.5 – £7.5 million (Electricity, Gas & Water).
- Evaluate, analyse and present recommendations to key stakeholders on the most cost effective contract structure/procurement strategy for each utility.
- Audit customer’s utility invoices to identify complex overcharges and recover refunds.
- Identify potential risks within changes to energy market fundamentals and understand how this will impact
customers.
- Assist client base with analysis of energy consumption data to identify unusual consumption patterns.

_Outside of job role_
- Proactively developed several Python scripts in my own time that use the Selenium/Requests library to automatically download customer invoices from multiple energy supplier’s portals, sorting each invoice based on priority ready for processing.
- Developed several tools to aid productivity in my own role mainly based around extracting data from websites/API’s automatically and extracting text from PDF documents.


**Allianz Global Assistance** (September 2013 to April 2016)  
_Senior Assistance Resolution Co-Ordinator October 2015 – April 2016_

_Relevant Experience_
- Creating VBA Macros to assist with reporting assistance case summaries to management.
- Mentoring junior members of the team

## Skills

#### Research/Independent Learning
During group projects at Makers Academy there were multiple opportunities to learn new technology with little to no guidance.

Over the course of 3 group projects I took the lead in investigating setting up an ORM (ActiveRecord), CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions) and the deployment of our MERN web app to Heroku.

Initially, I looked at the documentation provided by each of these technologies which can be intimidating to a junior developer. I took the time to research any concepts/terms within this documentation that I didn't understand. 

With this knowledge I then researched examples to make sure I fully understood the concepts and then implemented these into our project. It is important to me that I understand all the code I am writing.

I made sure to share this knowledge to my team and acted as a resource for any questions going forward.

#### Attention to detail
A responsibility of my previous role was to identify refund opportunities for my clients where their energy supplier has overcharged them. Some of the supplier errors can be incredibly intricate.

I was reviewing a prospective client's water invoices and noticed one particular charge seemed rather high. This charge is based on the area of land the client occupies (assigned to a band). I was able to calculate the true area of the property through Google Map's satellite view and using this evidence I made a claim to the water supplier. They accepted the error and refunded the customer several thousand pounds and also reduced the charge going forward.

This was a key factor in the company becoming a client of ours.

#### Working to deadlines
Another responsibility of my previous role was to tender my client's electricity, gas and water supplies to all relevant energy suppliers. This process is very time consuming, involving negotiating with suppliers and collating all pricing information to present to clients.

Due to the live nature of the energy market, contract offers are only valid for the day they are generated. It was crucial that I was organised in my approach to deliver on the expectations set by the client and to provide the most value during our meetings.

At Makers Academy, group projects were usually two weeks long. In order to make sure our apps were robust, we implemented feature freezes two days before the deadline so we could check for any bugs and refactor code where necessary. This gave us confidence in our app while presenting to the rest of the cohort.

## Education
